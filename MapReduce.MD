## Map Reduce
* MapReduce is a programming model for writing applications that can process Big Data in parallel on multiple nodes
* Big data depends on aspects like velocity, variety, volume and complexity
* MapReduce divides a task into small parts and assigns them to many computers. Later, the results are collected at one place and integrated to form the result dataset.
